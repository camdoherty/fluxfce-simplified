**Your role:**
You are a veteran Python programmer and Linux (XFCE) developer. You possess all skills and knowledge necessary to assist with development and debugging the included `fluxfce` Python project.

**Pre-work:**
Thoroughly analyze the `fluxfce` code base included as a single text file `codebase-2025-06-17.txt`.

You should have a complete understanding of how `fluxfce` functions and it's indended goals. 

**Issue:**
Currently, whenever `fluxfce` applies a theme, the theme is only partially applied. To fully apply a theme from the command line, including the title bars and borders, you must also set the corresponding theme for the window manager. This is done by using a separate xfconf-query command that targets the xfwm4 channel.

`fluxfce` currently sends a command like: `xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName -s "Materia-dark-compact"` to apply a theme.

Any time `fluxfce` applies a theme it needs to update both the the application and window decoration themes. Something like:
`xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName -s "Materia-dark-compact"`, AND,
`xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/theme -s "Materia-dark-compact"`

**Task:**

When you are confident that you fully understand the project and, the issue and how to fix it, proceed to update all necessary code to resolve the issue.

Provide complete functions or methods, etc, so I can easily copy/paste the code to implement.

Double check all code for correctness.





, the theme is applied but the title bar and borders of windows don't update with the theme's colors. Ie the theme, "Materia-dark-compact" has a dark title bars and borders but when I run that command the title bar and borders don't change at all. If I open `xfce4-settings` and click "Materia-dark-compact" theme in the GUI, the title bar and borders then apply correctly.

What causes this behavior and what is the command to fully apply a theme from cli?
xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName -s "Materia-dark-compact"
xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/theme -s "Materia-dark-compact"






Focus on the code related to systemd and scheduling. The scheduler service that runs shortly after midnight schedules the dynamic timers for upcoming sunrise/sunset events, but **when the scheduler service ran between 12:10 AM and 12:13 AM, 'Day Mode' was partially applied (xsct temperature and desktop background changed but Gtk theme did not.)


**Task:**
Review all relevant code and diagnose the issue.



When generating code, provide complete functions or methods, etc, or complete scripts if substantial changes are required.

**Your role:**
You are a veteran Python programmer and Linux (XFCE) developer. You possess all skills and knowledge necessary to assist with debugging and development of the `fluxfce` python project.

**Task:**
Thoroughly analyze the `fluxfce` code base and the three config files below. The code base is attached as a single text file, `codebase-2025-06-14.txt`. The config files are 'built' during install (`fluxfce install`)

You should have a complete understanding of how `fluxfce` works.

**Issue:**
Currently, if a day or night desktop background profile is saved with background color(s), eg:

```
cat ~/.config/fluxfce/backgrounds/default-day.profile
monitor=HDMI-0
workspace=workspace0
type=solid_color
color1=rgba(Value is an array with 4 items:,,1.000000,1.000000,1.000000,1.000000)

monitor=DP-0
workspace=workspace0
type=solid_color
color1=rgba(Value is an array with 4 items:,,1.000000,1.000000,1.000000,1.000000)

monitor=DP-2
workspace=workspace0
type=solid_color
color1=rgba(Value is an array with 4 items:,,1.000000,1.000000,1.000000,1.000000)

```

When I try to apply that profile with the `Apply Now` button, I get:

```
INFO: fluxfce_core.api: API Facade: Applying temporary mode 'day' (scheduling remains active)...
INFO: fluxfce_core.desktop_manager: Applying day mode appearance...

INFO: fluxfce_core.background_manager: Profile 'default-day' applied successfully.
```

I suspect this is related to the way the `Apply Now` logic parses the saved profile file.


Review the relevant code and propose a solution.

**Task 2:**

Review the code relating desktop background handling (colors, images) including any code related to the config and profile files.

The current default-day.profile/default-night.profile files (above) are inadequate, and the code needs to be refactored and improved, with the goal of eventually implementing a reliable xfce desktop background profile system. For now let's get it working with the default-day.profile default-night.profile

See the below command/output:
```
xfconf-query -c xfce4-desktop -l -v
/backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-0/workspace0/color-style     0
/backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-0/workspace0/image-style     0
/backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-0/workspace0/last-image      /usr/share/backgrounds/xfce/xfce-shapes.svg
/backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-0/workspace0/rgba1           <<UNSUPPORTED>>
/backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-0/workspace0/rgba2           <<UNSUPPORTED>>
/backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-2/workspace0/color-style     0
/backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-2/workspace0/image-style     0
/backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-2/workspace0/last-image      /home/cad/dev/fluxfce-simplified/fluxfce_core/assets/default-night.png
/backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-2/workspace0/rgba1           <<UNSUPPORTED>>
/backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-2/workspace0/rgba2           <<UNSUPPORTED>>
```
This command shows the properties for each monitor and workspace which can have several properties. The default-day.profile/default-night.profiles should store these values for monitor/workspace in a way that can easily be reapplied. Note that the <<UNSUPPORTED>> color values are arrays* -- we need a way to save these in the profile files as well. Below are examples of commands that reveal back ground color arrays:


Example commands for reference: 
- To apply a purple background color (to apply a gradient you would run the command again for rgba2)

```
xfconf-query -c xfce4-desktop -p "/backdrop/screen0/monitorHDMI-0/workspace0/rgba1" --create \
    -t double -s 0.380392 \
    -t double -s 0.207843 \
    -t double -s 0.513725 \
    -t double -s 1.000000
```

- To retreive background color(s) (this is a gradient)
```
 ❯ xfconf-query -c xfce4-desktop -p /backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-2/workspace0/rgba1
Value is an array with 4 items:

0.380392
0.207843
0.513725
1.000000

~ ❯ xfconf-query -c xfce4-desktop -p /backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-2/workspace0/rgba2
Value is an array with 4 items:

0.000000
0.000000
0.000000
1.000000
```


**(note:)** fluxfce commands that write these profile files (ie, `fluxfce install` and `fluxfce set-default --mode day|night`) should always write the desktop background properties in the config file for *all* connected monitors. Example (very rough):

```
monitor/workspace /backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-2
color-style     0
image-style     0
last-image      /home/cad/dev/fluxfce-simplified/fluxfce_core/assets/default-night.png
rgba1           <easily parsable array>
rgba2           <easily parsable array>


monitor/workspace /backdrop/screen0/monitorDP-0
color-style     0
image-style     0
last-image      /home/cad/dev/fluxfce-simplified/fluxfce_core/assets/default-night.png
rgba1           <array>
rgba2           <array>

monitor/workspace /backdrop/screen0/monitorHDMI-0
color-style     0
image-style     0
last-image      /home/cad/dev/fluxfce-simplified/fluxfce_core/assets/default-night.png
rgba1           <easily parsable array>
rgba2           <easily parsable array>
```
