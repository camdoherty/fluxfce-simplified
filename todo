(Proper Installation - Recommended for distribution):
  - Create packaging files (e.g., pyproject.toml).
  - Run 'pip install .' in the project directory (/home/cad/dev/fluxfce-simplified).
  - This installs the 'fluxfce_core' library and places the 'fluxfce' command correctly.

done- The initial script interactively prompted for coordinates and timezone. Can we re-add that? Eventually we will add the drop-down menu for city, but for now we should allow the user to input lat/long and timezone. Data should be validated. Does this make sense?

done - uninstall should prompt to remove '~/.config/fluxfce'

done - There is an issue with the set-default command related to xsct.
'set-default --mode day|night' 
WARNING: fluxfce_core.xfce: Could not find brightness pattern in xsct output: 'Screen 0: temperature ~ 6500 1.000000'

done- is there a better way to handle screen brightness and temperature? xrandr? -- not really


done-Next we need to update the output messages during install. Currently it appears like this:
```
~/dev/fluxfce-simplified main ❯ fluxfce install
Starting installation...
Systemd units installed. Enabling scheduling...
FluxFCE installed and enabled successfully.
Please ensure this script is executable and in your system's PATH.
```

we need to update it as follows (rough draft - make it look good)
```
~/dev/fluxfce-simplified main ❯ fluxfce install  
Starting installation...
Systemd units installed. Enabling scheduling...
<add blank line here >
--- fluxfce installed and enabled successfully. --- # update case of fluxfce (no caps), and add dashes or appropriate indicator for visibility
<add blank line here >
Please ensure this script is executable and in your system's PATH.
<provide brief instructions with example commands to add the script to the PATH>
<add blank line here >
<provide brief instructions to set-default --mode day|night>
```
