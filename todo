default-day.profile    default-night.profile

**Your role:**
You are a veteran Python programmer and Linux (XFCE) developer. You possess all skills necessary to assist with debugging and development of the included `fluxfce` python project.

**Your task:**
Analyze the included Python project, `fluxfce`. The code base is included as a single text file, `codebase-2025-06-10.txt`). 

Review the code until you have a complete and thorough understanding of the intent of the project and how it functions.

**Focus on the install logic (`fluxfce install`).**
**The goal is to make the install process interactive and user friendly while retaining or improving functionality.**


Notice how config.ini is installed to ~/.config/fluxfce/config.ini

I want the install 

default config.ini:
```
[Location]
latitude = 43.65N ## see below *
longitude = 79.38W ## see below *
timezone = America/Toronto ## see below *

[Theme]  # Change this from '[Appearance]'
light_theme = Arc-Lighter
dark_theme = Materia-dark-compact

[Background] # This should be separate from '[Appearance]'
day_background_profile = default-day
night_background_profile = default-night

[ScreenDay]
xsct_temp = 6500
xsct_bright = 1.00

[ScreenNight]
xsct_temp = 5000
xsct_bright = 1.00
```
* The install logic should attempt to find the system's timezone (determine the best / reliable way to code this on xfce systems and parse the output (example format: America/New_York))
* If a timezone is found, prompt the user, example; "<found timezone> found. Should we use these coordinates?" 
  * **I have added file `fluxfce_core/timezones.json` which the install process can use to find coordinates respective to the found timezone. Here is a snippet of the file:**

```json
{
  "Toronto": {
    "latitude": "43.65N",
    "longitude": "79.38W",
    "timezone": "America/Toronto"
  },
  "Mexico City": {
    "latitude": "19.43N",
    "longitude": "99.13W",
    "timezone": "America/Mexico_City"
  },
  "New York City": {
    "latitude": "40.71N",
    "longitude": "74.01W",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  },
...
```
* If the user responds with N to the above then the install logic should prompt user to enter coordinates manually. data validation is required here.

Review the above prompt and rewrite it for Gemini in a way that makes more sense (i'm tired so please infer my intention). Also, think about standard interactive installs, what are the best approaches to this without over engineering?

Don't provide any code other than what's necessary for the prompt.









when scheduler service runs (after midnight if the user session is active), no appearance changes should be immediatetly applied. this service 

- Add connected monitors detection before . This is needed to populate the config file



create a function that detects all connected monitors and/or workspaces during install and set-default. The day and night profile files are dependent and knowing which monitors are connected.


FEATURE: A gradual transition service can be a completely separate systemd unit and script - as long as the final temp/bright values are the same as what is applied by the sunrise/sunset services

FEATURE: Profile saving eg `fx save-profile <profile-name>

(Proper Installation - Recommended for distribution):
  - Create packaging files (e.g., pyproject.toml).
  - Run 'pip install .' in the project directory (/home/cad/dev/fluxfce-simplified).
  - This installs the 'fluxfce_core' library and places the 'fluxfce' command correctly.

GUI?
slow transition?
Python AppIndicator

done - issue: if system when the system wakes from suspend *and* the system was not locked (i.e. the system loaded directly to desktop without log in), the theme switch does not occur. Determine the best approach to resolve this and provide a solution

done- The initial script interactively prompted for coordinates and timezone. Can we re-add that? Eventually we will add the drop-down menu for city, but for now we should allow the user to input lat/long and timezone. Data should be validated. Does this make sense?

done - uninstall should prompt to remove '~/.config/fluxfce'

done - There is an issue with the set-default command related to xsct.
'set-default --mode day|night' 
WARNING: fluxfce_core.xfce: Could not find brightness pattern in xsct output: 'Screen 0: temperature ~ 6500 1.000000'

done- is there a better way to handle screen brightness and temperature? xrandr? -- not really


done-Next we need to update the output messages during install. Currently it appears like this:
```
~/dev/fluxfce-simplified main ❯ fluxfce install
Starting installation...
Systemd units installed. Enabling scheduling...
FluxFCE installed and enabled successfully.
Please ensure this script is executable and in your system's PATH.
```

we need to update it as follows (rough draft - make it look good)
```
~/dev/fluxfce-simplified main ❯ fluxfce install  
Starting installation...
Systemd units installed. Enabling scheduling...
<add blank line here >
--- fluxfce installed and enabled successfully. --- # update case of fluxfce (no caps), and add dashes or appropriate indicator for visibility
<add blank line here >
Please ensure this script is executable and in your system's PATH.
<provide brief instructions with example commands to add the script to the PATH>
<add blank line here >
<provide brief instructions to set-default --mode day|night>
```

(Proper Installation - Recommended for distribution):
  - Create packaging files (e.g., pyproject.toml).
  - Run 'pip install .' in the project directory (/home/cad/dev/fluxfce-simplified).
  - This installs the 'fluxfce_core' library and places the 'fluxfce' command correctly.
