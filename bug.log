When I click Apply Now while that mode is already active, I see the following lines repeatedly in terminal:

```
INFO: fluxfce_core.xfce: Retrieved screen settings: Temp=4500, Brightness=1.00
INFO: fluxfce_core.xfce: Retrieved screen settings: Temp=4500, Brightness=1.00
INFO: fluxfce_core.xfce: Retrieved screen settings: Temp=4500, Brightness=1.00
```

The polling was introduced so that the temp control slider updates after changes to the xsct temperature.

Please review and determine the best way to fix the issue.

Provide excellent, functional python code.

, sometimes open windows title bar and border colors don't update -- if I go into the xfce4-settings and click the theme that is already currently applied, the title bar and border color will update correctly.


Add a row below Background Profile: 'Color Temperature:  <day|night color temp'

This value should be read from ~/.config/fluxfce/config.ini

config.ini example:
```

[Location]
latitude = 43.65N
longitude = 79.38W
timezone = America/Toronto

[Appearance]
light_theme = Arc-Lighter
dark_theme = Materia-dark-compact
day_background_profile = default-day
night_background_profile = default-night

[ScreenDay]
xsct_temp = 6500 ## THIS VALUE for day
xsct_bright = 1.00

[ScreenNight]
xsct_temp = 4500 ## THIS VALUE for night
xsct_bright = 1.00
```

Next Transition: countdown timer needs to refresh every 1 minute




Add a button to open xfce4-settings after the <theme name> in both Theme rows. It should be aligned with the 'Open profile in text editor' buttons

the the Theme line for both day and night
