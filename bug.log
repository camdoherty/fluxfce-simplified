should not appear in the launcher when open

transition service


This is great but there a couple issues.

1. left clicking on the system tray icon should display the window and right clicking should display the tray menu
2. the window is not displaying in the correct location. it should display like a tray application like the volume control. I suspect the window is currently appearing centered above the mouse cursor but I'm not sure

Please review the relevant code and correct these issues.

3. change the tray menu item Apply Mode 


Bug: 
When the window *first* opens (by clicking the system tray icon) it displays in the center of the screen. Each time after, it opens in the correct location in the bottom right of the screen. Please fix this.

GUI tweaks:
Instead of having one 'Reset Screen' button, there should be Reset buttons to the right of to both temp <xsct_temp> and bright <xsct_bright> readings. Use a reset icon for the new buttons.








Okay, next we need to refactor the Day and Night mode 'frames'. They should not be collapsable, instead should be a compact grid/table, well layed out. Something like this:


Profiles		
‚òÄÔ∏è Day Mode (make this the button to apply)	Save Current (button)	Background .profile (button)
  - <profile theme>		
  - <profile xsct temp>, <profile xsct brightness>		
		
üåô Night Mode (make this the button to apply)	Save Current (button)	Background .profile (button)
  - <profile theme>		
  - <profile xsct temp>, <profile xsct brightness>		

---

- Also the temperature icon next to the slider appears not to be found.

- Also hide the title bar of the GUI window


First, 




```
Assist with troubleshooting the following Linux XFCE issue.

When a theme is applied via cli with, eg, `xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName -s "Materia-dark-compact"`, the theme is applied but the title bar and borders of windows don't update with the theme's colors. Ie the theme, "Materia-dark-compact" has a dark title bars and borders but when I run that command the title bar and borders don't change at all. If I open `xfce4-settings` and click "Materia-dark-compact" theme in the GUI, the title bar and borders then apply correctly.

What causes this behavior and what is the command to fully apply a theme from cli?


xfconf-query -c xsettings -p /Net/ThemeName -s "Materia-dark-compact"
xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/theme -s "Materia-dark-compact"
```

```

Key issue: When the secheduler service ran at midnight, Day mode was partially applied. 
 -  This may have been due to old files in __pycache__
 -  removing the __pycache__ directory and manually running the secheduler service did not reproduce 


```

[Location]
latitude = 43.65N
longitude = 79.38W
timezone = America/Toronto

[Appearance]
light_theme = Arc-Lighter
dark_theme = Materia-dark-compact
day_background_profile = default-day
night_background_profile = default-night

[ScreenDay]
xsct_temp = 6500 ## THIS VALUE for day
xsct_bright = 1.00

[ScreenNight]
xsct_temp = 4500 ## THIS VALUE for night
xsct_bright = 1.00
```

Next Transition: countdown timer needs to refresh every 1 minute




Add a button to open xfce4-settings after the <theme name> in both Theme rows. It should be aligned with the 'Open profile in text editor' buttons

the the Theme line for both day and night
