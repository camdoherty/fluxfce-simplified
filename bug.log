When a theme is applied with via cli, sometimes two themes appear (according to neofetch):
```
...
WM: Xfwm4 
WM Theme: Arc-Lighter 
Theme: Adwaita [GTK2/3] 
Icons: Mint-Y-Orange [GTK2/3] 
Terminal: xfce4-terminal 
...
```


Key issue: When the secheduler service ran at midnight, Day mode was partially applied. 
 -  This may have been due to old files in __pycache__
 -  removing the __pycache__ directory and manually running the secheduler service did not reproduce 


```

[Location]
latitude = 43.65N
longitude = 79.38W
timezone = America/Toronto

[Appearance]
light_theme = Arc-Lighter
dark_theme = Materia-dark-compact
day_background_profile = default-day
night_background_profile = default-night

[ScreenDay]
xsct_temp = 6500 ## THIS VALUE for day
xsct_bright = 1.00

[ScreenNight]
xsct_temp = 4500 ## THIS VALUE for night
xsct_bright = 1.00
```

Next Transition: countdown timer needs to refresh every 1 minute




Add a button to open xfce4-settings after the <theme name> in both Theme rows. It should be aligned with the 'Open profile in text editor' buttons

the the Theme line for both day and night
