Description: Automatic XFCE theming based on sunrise and sunset times.
 FluxFCE automates switching XFCE desktop appearance (GTK Theme, Background,
 Screen Temperature) between user-defined Day and Night modes.
 .
 It uses systemd user timers for precise, low-resource scheduling of
 transitions at local sunrise and sunset. The package includes both a
 command-line interface (fluxfce) and a system tray GUI (fluxfce-gui)
 for management.
